**Your answer:**


1.a. The shape of the jacobian is '(N = 64, if_features = 1024, N = 64, out_features = 512)' 

1.b. yes, this matrix is sparse. because $\forall j\neq i:\frac{\partial y_i}{\partial x_j} = 0$, 
     and this is because we treat each sample independently from the rest of the batch.
     
1.c. There is no need to materialize the jacobian,  we can calculate $\frac{\partial L}{\partial X}$
     by performing matrix multiplication: $\frac{\partial L}{\partial Y} \times W$ 
     
2.a. The shape of the jacobian is '(N = 64, out_features = 512, out_features = 512, in_features = 1024)'

2.b. yes, this matrix is sparse. because $\forall k\neq j:\frac{\partial Y_{(i, j)}}{\partial W_{(k, y)}} = 0$, 
     and this is because each neuron is only effected by hhis owm weights.
     
2.c. There is no need to materialize the jacobian,  we can calculate $\frac{\partial L}{\partial Y}$
     by performing matrix multiplication: $\frac{\partial L}{\partial Y}^T \times X$

part1_q2 = r"""
**Your answer:**


Yes we can! we can train a neural network without back propagation. we can expand the expression of the loss as a function of each o our
parameters, deriviate it analiticly by hand and so find the gradient with respept to each parameter. 

However, this approach is very hard to implement. And would require redoing the calculations every time we change the networking.
Making nerual networks withour backprop not very feasible.
